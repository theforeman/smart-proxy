This directory is reserved for data in development mode. To access it, use
DATA_DIR constant. Plugins should create subdirectories within the directory.

The constant is set to /var/lib/foreman-proxy, if such directory exists.
Otherwise this directory is used. When running tests, DATA_DIR is set to
../tmp/data.
