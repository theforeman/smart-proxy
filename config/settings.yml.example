# SSL Setup
# If enabled, all communication would be verified via SSL
# NOTE that both certificates need to be signed by the same CA in order for this to work
# see http://theforeman.org/projects/smart-proxy/wiki/SSL for more information
#:ssl_certificate: ssl/certs/fqdn.pem
#:ssl_ca_file: ssl/certs/ca.pem
#:ssl_private_key: ssl/private_keys/fqdn.key

# Use this option only if you need to disable certain cipher suites.
# Note: we use the OpenSSL suite name, such as "RC4-MD5".
# The complete list of cipher suite names can be found at:
# https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/ciphers.html#CIPHER-SUITE-NAMES
#:ssl_disabled_ciphers: [CIPHER-SUITE-1, CIPHER-SUITE-2]

# Use this option only if you need to strictly specify TLS
# versions to be used. SSLv3 is disabled and cannot be configured.
# TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 are available are the default configurations.
#:ssl_versions: ['TLSv1.2']

# Hosts which the proxy accepts connections from
# commenting the following lines would mean every verified SSL connection allowed
# HTTPS: test the certificate CN
# HTTP: test the reverse DNS entry of the remote IP
#:trusted_hosts:
#- foreman.prod.domain
#- foreman.dev.domain
#to deny access to all hosts use:
#:trusted_hosts: []

# verify a DNS reverse lookup against it's forward lookup
# 1.1.1.1 -> foreman.mycompany.com -> 1.1.1.1
# (default: true)
#:forward_verify: true

# SSL settings for client authentication against Foreman. If undefined, the values
# from general SSL options are used instead. Mainly useful when Foreman uses
# different certificates for its web UI and for smart-proxy requests.

#:foreman_ssl_key: ssl/private_keys/fqdn.pem

# by default smart_proxy runs in the foreground. To enable running as a daemon, uncomment 'daemon' setting

# Uncomment and modify if you want to change the default pid file '/var/run/foreman-proxy/foreman-proxy.pid'

# host and ports configuration
# an array of interfaces to bind ports to (possible values: *, localhost, 0.0.0.0)

# http is disabled by default. To enable, uncomment 'http_port' setting
#:http_port: 8000
# https is enabled if certificate, CA certificate, and private key are present in locations specifed by
# ssl_certificate, ssl_ca_file, and ssl_private_key correspondingly
# default values for https_port is 8443
#:https_port: 8443

# Log configuration
# Uncomment and modify if you want to change the location of the log file or use STDOUT or SYSLOG values
#:log_file: /var/log/foreman-proxy/proxy.log
# Uncomment and modify if you want to change the log level
# WARN, DEBUG, ERROR, FATAL, INFO, UNKNOWN
#:log_level: INFO

# Log buffer size and extra buffer size (for errors). Defaults to 3000 messages in total,
# which is about 500 kB request.
